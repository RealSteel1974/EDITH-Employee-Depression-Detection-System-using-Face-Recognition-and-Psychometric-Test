Why Haar Cascade is Still Used?
Despite being old, Haar Cascade is still used in some scenarios because of the following advantages:

Lightweight:
It does not require GPUs or heavy computation.
Suitable for low-resource environments, such as mobile devices or edge systems

Speed:
Works well for basic, real-time applications where accuracy is not critical.

Pre-trained Models:
OpenCV provides readily available pre-trained XML files for common objects (e.g., faces, eyes, smiles).

Simplicity:
Easy to implement and deploy for quick prototyping.
